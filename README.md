Safety.NET

Dynamic platform for hosting events and implementing security measures.

We intend to make attending large gatherings feel safe and better organized.
This process is designed to be simple for the customer while building a temporary secure framework around hosting events.
This platform allows you to create events that issue “guest passes” which will be used as tickets while attending the event.

Each ticket :

    - will have an expiration

    - can be used to gain access to locations and features within each event

    - unique ticket is attached to email at time of purchase

    - has dynamic QR code allowing for added functionality.

    - currently styled with photo, name ,email and QR code

    - can be scanned to gain access, verify access and has separate access to administrators from any device

    	able to scan QR codes.

The main reason for this platform is to be able to hold all parties accountable while attending event.
should a disaster happen during an event, having a list of all those who where actively attending could be invaluable.
Security is based on tokens on a time limit with future implementation of a location based system.
customer database will be held (first name, last name and email) for ease of use for future events.
