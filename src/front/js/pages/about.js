          We are a dynamic platform for hosting events and implementing security
          measures. We intend to make attending large gatherings feel safe and
          better organized. This process is designed to be simple for the
          customer while building a temporary secure framework around hosting
          events. This platform allows you to create events that issue “guest
          passes” which will be used as tickets while attending the event.
