//Main event page.

//Needs to have details on event


//Has button to sign up for events

//Has button for Admin/coordinator login

// Button to sign up should open a form in a modal or link to new page.

// Should be able to send email automatically after member fills and submits form. 



// I will be adding a blank page in our "/src/pages" that can be deleted if we are using modal instead.
